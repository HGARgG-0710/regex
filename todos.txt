1. Documentation
2. For future: 

	2.1. Add validation API; 
	2.2. Reverse the parser (generator improvement);
	2.3.?possibly: 
		Fix the 'chars' remains - untended-to 'excl', and so forth... 
		Those do not serve as anything beyond plain symbols... No reason for them to remain "specially marked"
		after the parsing has been done...;
