1. For future: 

	1.1. Add validation API; 
	1.2. Reverse the parser (generator improvement);
	1.3.?possibly: 
		Fix the 'chars' remains - untended-to 'excl', and so forth... 
		Those do not serve as anything beyond plain symbols... No reason for them to remain "specially marked"
		after the parsing has been done...; 
	1.4. Experiment with the order of table's args (performance increase) + (possibly), add more positions to the tables...
