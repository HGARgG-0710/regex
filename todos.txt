1. To finish: 	

	1.1. parser; 
	1.2. generator; 

2. Test; 
3. Documentation; 
4. For future: 

	4.1. Add validation API; 
	4.2. Reverse the parser (generator improvement);
	4.3.?possibly: 
		Fix the 'chars' remains - untended-to 'excl', and so forth... 
		Those do not serve as anything beyond plain symbols... No reason for them to remain "specially marked"
		after the parsing has been done...;
